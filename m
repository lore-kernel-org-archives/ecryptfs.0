Linus recently made the page lock more fair.  That means that the old
pattern where we returned from ->readpage with the page unlocked and
then attempted to re-lock it will send us to the back of the queue for
this page's lock.

Ideally all filesystems would return from ->readpage with the
page Uptodate and Locked, but it's a bit painful to convert all the
asynchronous readpage implementations to synchronous.  These ones are
already synchronous, so convert them while I work on iomap.

A further benefit is that a synchronous readpage implementation allows
us to return an error to someone who might actually care about it.
There's no need to SetPageError, but I don't want to learn about how
a dozen filesystems handle I/O errors (hint: they're all different),
so I have not attempted to change that.

Please review your filesystem carefully.  I've tried to catch all the
places where a filesystem calls its own internal readpage implementation
without going through ->readpage, but I may have missed some.
